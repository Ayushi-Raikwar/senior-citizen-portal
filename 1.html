        <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;">1.  Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS)</h1>  <br>
        Retirees in India are on the lookout for schemes that offer the highest safety and regular income for them. Many consider the best senior citizen investment schemes to be those that are regarded as safe because they are backed by a sovereign guarantee i.e. backed by the Government of India. One such investment is the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme (SCSS), a product offered by the Government of India since August 2004.
        
        SCSS is a central government-backed savings scheme. It is a full debt instrument with zero risks. Valid for those above 60 years of age, it gives the security of assured income for the entire tenure of investment.
        
        Let’s look at all the details of the Senior Citizen Saving Scheme:
        Eligibility
        This investment plan for senior citizens is only for Indians aged 60 years and above. It is not applicable for HUFs (Hindu Undivided Family) or NRIs (Non-Resident Indians). The only exception in age criteria are citizens who opt for the Voluntary Retirement Scheme (VRS) or Superannuation while they’re 55-60 years of age or retired defense personnel between 50 and 60 years of age.
        
        Rate of Interest
        The current interest rate offered by this senior citizen scheme is 7.4%. These rates are reviewed every quarter, with the last review being March 31, 2021. This new rate applies solely to new deposits from that date, not to already existing ones. While SCSS rates of interest are open to being revised every quarter, these changes will not apply to already-enrolled investors. New rates of interest only apply to newer investors of a particular quarter.

        
        The main aim of this investment option for senior citizens is to assure regular income post-retirement, for a period of at least 5 years. Taking stock of all its variables, this investment option for senior citizens takes on a medium-risk profile, especially if compared to something like PPF which is low-risk but was the biggest attraction for senior citizens, when avenues for retirement years were fewer, as compared to the bouquet of options on a date. The guarantee of regular income and capital protection has made SCSS a popular option since its inception.
        
         <h1 style="text-decoration: underline;" > 2.  Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana (PMVVY)</h1> <br>
        In the year 2017, the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana was introduced for all senior citizens. Operated and managed by LIC (Life Insurance Corporation), Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana is a retirement-cum-pension scheme. It is an instant annuity plan that provides a fixed sum regularly to you as an investor, once you invest a lump sum amount in this scheme.
        
        This investment option for senior citizens was initially offered from May 4, 2017, to March 31, 2020. It was then extended for an additional 3 years – up to March 31, 2023.
        
        Here are the complete details of the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana:
        Eligibility
        
        So, the year 2020-21 sees an assured rate of return at 7.4% per annum, which is then to be re-analyzed and re-set each following year, until the onset of the final date of March 31, 2023.
        
        Investment Amount
        In this senior citizen scheme, the minimum purchase price is much higher. PMVVY starts out at Rs.1.5 Lakh. The maximum purchase price is Rs.15 Lakh. Interestingly, the maximum purchase price was initially set for Rs.7.5 Lakh but was then increased after the first year itself.
        
        Pension Amount
        Pension through PMVVY is fixed, irrespective of your age as an investor. Further, as an investor in this scheme, you can avail of a loan of up to 75% of your purchase price once you have completed 3 years in this scheme.
        
        If you are keen to invest in the Pradhan Mantri Vaya Vandana Yojana for your retirement security, you just need to approach LIC – the only institution that offers this plan. Both offline and online options to open this account are currently available to you.
        
        
        
         
          <h1  style="text-decoration: underline;">3.  Mutual Funds</h1><br>
        Mutual funds pool money from multiple investors and invest it across various assets classes like Equity and Debt. They are managed by experts called fund managers who ensure that the fund’s investment objectives are met. As mentioned above, most fixed-income investment instruments are only capable of providing inflation-level returns; in contrast, mutual fund returns have the potential to beat inflation by a significant margin.
        
        Post-retirement, your risk appetite decreases, and the safety of capital becomes the most important aspect. Investing largely in equity-oriented mutual fund schemes may expose you to a level of volatility that may not be comfortable, especially in the short term. Hence, you can either invest in Debt Mutual Funds or Hybrid Mutual Funds with little or no equity exposure. The choice can be made as per your risk appetite and upcoming goals.
        
        Let us look at the details of Mutual Fund Investments:
        Returns
        Different types of Mutual Funds have different degrees of exposure to different types of assets and provide different levels of returns. Mutual Fund returns are market-linked and hence, never fixed. But in this exposure to risk lies the opportunity for wealth creation and growth. If you are retired and are looking to park your money for the short-term, you can consider short-term Debt Funds that invest in bonds that lend to companies with a good credit rating for 1 to 3 years. These Debt Funds can deliver better returns than a bank FD.
        
        Moreover, if you want some exposure to both Debt and Equity investments, you can invest in Conservative Hybrid Funds that have 10-25% of their allocation to equities and 75-90% allocated towards debt securities. While the debt portion offers you the safety of capital and stable returns, the equity exposure can offer wealth creation opportunities. Here are the category average returns for 10 years –
        <br>
        Type of mutual fund	Category Average Returns (10 Yr)
        Short term/Duration funds	7.81%
        Conservative Hybrid funds	8.34%
